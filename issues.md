# Goldberg Earth Visualization - Issues Report

## Current Status
All previously identified visual and interactive issues have been resolved:
- **Smooth Shading**: The faceted "disco ball" look was fixed by enabling smooth normals.
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Hovering now uses a solid white highlight and a 3D center sphere for precision.
- **Artifact Removal**: The illusory "large hexagon" patterns were eliminated by removing the high-density cell outlines.

## Remaining/New Issues
- *(None currently identified)*
